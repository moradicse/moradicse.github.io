<h3><a id="abo">About Me</a></h3>
    I am deeply passionate about computer networks, with a particular focus on optimization, Quality of Service (QoS) implementation, network management mechanisms, and performance enhancement through strategic routing and robust firewall rules. My advanced studies in computer networks have further fueled my interest in next-generation firewalls, which offer deeper network control and ensure a robust network for all users in a Wide Area Network (WAN).
    <br />
    In addition to my interest in networks, I am also fascinated by cloud virtualization software, especially those that utilize a shared host operating system, such as Docker. This interest stems from my belief in the power of virtualization to optimize resource usage and facilitate scalable solutions.
